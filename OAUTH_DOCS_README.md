# Google OAuth Environment Variables\n\nThese files provide detailed instructions for setting up Google OAuth with Vercel deployments:\n\n1. AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md - Updated main guide with deployment-specific information\n2. DEPLOYMENT.md - Enhanced with OAuth environment variables and CLI commands\n\nThe additional files (OAUTH_ENV_VARIABLES.md and VERCEL_OAUTH_SETUP.md) that were in the previous PR have been removed to avoid conflicts.
