This PR improves perceived latency of streaming responses and makes OAuth issues visible on the login page.

Changes
- Send proper SSE headers on chat streaming endpoints (`POST /api/chat`, `GET /api/chat/[id]/stream`) to reduce proxy buffering and speed up time-to-first-byte.
- Lower client streaming throttle from 100ms to 0ms for snappier token updates.
- Show NextAuth error messages on the `/login` page by reading `?error=` and mapping common codes to human-readable guidance.

Why
- Some environments/proxies buffer responses without `text/event-stream`, `no-transform`, and `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, delaying the first streamed chunk.
- Users reported “streaming takes far too long to come through” and “sign in shows an error page.” The UI now surfaces the concrete NextAuth error to diagnose quickly.

Notes for Sign-in Configuration
- Ensure these env vars are set on Vercel:
  - `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`
  - `POSTGRES_URL` (for user creation on first sign-in)
  - Consider `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` and `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL=https://<primary-domain>` (or set `NEXTAUTH_URL`) for preview/custom domains.
- In Google Cloud Console, add exact redirect URIs (no wildcards):
  - `https://<domain>/api/auth/callback/google` for each domain you use.

Impact
- No breaking API changes. Streaming paths maintain payload format; only headers are added.
- Login page now displays a small non-intrusive error banner when `?error=` is present.

Testing
- Verify streaming tokens appear promptly after sending a message.
- Trigger a known NextAuth error (e.g., temporary bad client secret) and confirm the error banner appears on `/login`.
