Title: Make Temporal optional for chat streaming via NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPORAL_ENABLED

Summary
- Remove Temporal requirement for basic chat streaming by gating all client-side Temporal calls behind NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPORAL_ENABLED (default: off).
- Keeps model selection cookie updates intact; Temporal APIs remain available but are not invoked unless explicitly enabled.
- Improves deployability on Vercel and simplifies local usage without a running Temporal service.

Changes
- hooks/useTemporalChat.ts: 
  - Added TEMPORAL_ENABLED flag: const TEMPORAL_ENABLED = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPORAL_ENABLED === 'true'.
  - startChat now no-ops and returns null when disabled.
  - Approval helpers (requestApproval, getPendingApprovals, approveRequest) no-op when disabled.
  - Existing updateModel continues to set the model cookie; Temporal update is skipped unless a workflow is active and Temporal is enabled.

Why
- Streaming via the /api/chat route is independent of Temporal. Previously, the UI attempted to start/signals workflows opportunistically, which could fail when Temporal isn’t provisioned.
- This change removes that implicit requirement so streaming works out-of-the-box without running a Temporal service.

Impact
- No breaking changes. Existing Temporal deployments can enable the feature by setting NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPORAL_ENABLED=true in the environment.
- When disabled, UI will not try to connect to Temporal; server-side Temporal API routes remain intact for future/optional usage.

Deployment
- Vercel production: add NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPORAL_ENABLED=true only if you want the client to talk to Temporal.
- No change required for basic streaming; default behavior uses the non-Temporal /api/chat SSE pipeline.

Testing
- Manual: Verified that sending a message streams as usual without any Temporal service.
- Temporal paths are only exercised when NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPORAL_ENABLED=true.
